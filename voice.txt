Who cares for the understanding of God, everyone is mindful of that which is temporary. People say there is no God, and keep traditions made up by false institutions which caused great bloodshed upon the Earth. The teachings are not based on the prophets of old, there is a lack of truth and no want of it in the Earth. Your sabbath is unknown, your ways are unknown, the people walk after whatever makes them feel good, the masses are like sheep gone astray. Vanity is their God, they want only what benefits themselves and feeds into their image.
